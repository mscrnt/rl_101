# DIAMBRA RL Course

Welcome to the **DIAMBRA RL Course**! This is a self-paced, beginner-friendly course designed to teach you how to create, train, and improve reinforcement learning (RL) agents using the DIAMBRA platform.

## Course Overview
This course provides hands-on experience with:

- Setting up your environment to work with DIAMBRA Arena.
- Exploring game environments supported by DIAMBRA.
- Running basic RL agents and understanding their behavior.
- Training agents using RL algorithms like PPO.
- Evaluating and improving agent performance.
- Participating in DIAMBRA competitions to showcase your agent.

## Who is This For?
This course is perfect for:

- Beginners with no prior programming experience.
- Anyone interested in learning reinforcement learning using gaming environments.
- Learners who prefer self-paced study and practical examples.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before starting the course, ensure you have the following:

- A computer with Python 3.8+ installed.
- Basic knowledge of how to run Python scripts (no programming experience required).
- Jupyter Notebook installed for running interactive tutorials.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
