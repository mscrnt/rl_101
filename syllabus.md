### Module 6: Understanding Training Parameters
- **Key Parameters for Training**
  - Importance of learning rate, batch size, exploration vs. exploitation, and training steps.
- **Monitoring Progress**
  - Use training logs and reward graphs to track agent performance.
  - Understand when an agent is overfitting or underfitting.
- **Activity:**
  - Experiment with training parameters in a Jupyter notebook and observe their impact on agent behavior.
